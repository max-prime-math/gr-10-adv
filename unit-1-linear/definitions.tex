\textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition} & \textbf{Example}\\
\hline
Slope & The measure of a line's steepness, measured by rise over run. & The hill's significant slope made cycling uphill a challenging workout. \\[.5in]
\hline
$y$-intercept & The point where a line crosses the vertical ($y$) axis on a graph; the $y$-value when $x$ is zero. & \\[.5in]
\hline
$y$-intercept & & To find when the savings account would be empty, we calculated the $x$-intercept of the line. \\[.5in]
\hline
Linear Equation & & \\[.5in]
\hline
 & A real-number value that a variable is being multiplied by. & It is 3 in the term $3x$, indicating three times the value of $x$. \\[.5in]
\hline
Constant & A value in an expression or equation that does not change; a fixed number. & \\[.5in]
\hline
Solution & & \\[.5in]
\hline
Rate of Change & The measure of how one quantity changes in relation to another; often represented by the slope. & \\[.5in]
\hline
Independent Variable & & \\[.5in]
\hline
 & The variable in a function or equation whose value depends on the value of the independent variable. & \\[.5in]
\hline
System of Linear Equations & & \\[.5in]
\hline
Point of Intersection & The point where two or more lines cross on a graph, representing a common solution. & \\[.5in]
\hline
Parallel Lines & & \\[.5in]
