The highest air ever achieved on a skateboard is over 7 metres, set by Danny Way in 2015.  He was in the air for 2.5 seconds.
\begin{tasks}
\task How high was the air?  (Show your work!  Don't just look it up.)
\task How fast was he travelling when he left the ramp?
\task For how many seconds was he over 5 metres in the air?
\task Suppose Tony Hawk launched off the ramp going the same speed, but shortly after Danny, and they collided when they were both 5 meters in the air.  How long after Danny did Tony launch off the ramp?
\end{tasks}
Hint: Use a stretch factor of $-5$ for this parabola.  The correct stretch factor is closer to $-4.9$, which is half of Earthâ€™s gravity measured in metres per second squared.  We're going to use $-5$ to make our algebra nicer. Ask you physics teacher why it's 4.9!
