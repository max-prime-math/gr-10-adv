#strong[Introduction] \
In the first chapter, we dealt with functions that could be sketched as
a straight line. We observed how they intersected with each other, and
how we can use algebra to describe those intersections. \
In the second chapter, we learned about polynomial functions, namely
quadratics, and how they can be graphed. We spent a great deal of time
finding roots of a quadratic, and even learned about imaginary numbers.
\
In this chapter, we will learn about the inverse of a quadratic â€“ a
radical. We will learn how to play with these kinds of numbers, what
#emph[kinds] of numbers they can be, and how to express them in various
ways. \
Try this warm up to see if you can get all of these facts right.
